Our lab is dedicated to advancing the field of plant breeding and genetics, with a particular focus on tropical ornamental plants. We aim to develop new cultivars that not only meet industry standards for elite traits but also align with sustainable agricultural practices. By integrating conventional breeding methods, such as hybridization, mutation, and ploidy manipulation, with cutting-edge genomic and bioinformatics techniques, we strive to enhance the efficiency of breeding programs. Additionally, we are committed to supporting the ornamental industry by providing research-based information that aids in decision-making and promotes sustainable innovation.
